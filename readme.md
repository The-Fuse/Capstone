# Full Stack Coaching institute API Backend

## About
The Coaching institute a company that is responsible for  taking admission of students  for counselling by a teacher. A user needs to have appropriate permissions to get, post, patch or delete teachers and students in the database.

The app has counsellor who can get all details of teachers and students and search the students, but not change anything.
However, the viceprincipal have the permission to see all details of get any teacher and student data and also change any details or add more teachers or students but can't delete any teacher and students.
But Principal has all the permissions to change, add, update , search or delete any teacher or students data via correct endpoints.

The permission tokens are added under 'JWT Tokens' section of readme.

All the endpoints and their implementations are added under 'Endpoints' section of readme. However to use them, you have to use postman or curl.

## DEPLOYMENT
The app is hosted live on heroku at the URL: 
http://coaching123.herokuapp.com/

However, there is no frontend for this app yet, and it can only be presently used to authenticate using Auth0 by entering
credentials and retrieving a fresh token to use with curl or postman.

## THIRD-PARTY AUTHENTICATION
#### auth.py
Auth0 is set up and running. The following configurations are in a .env file which is exported by the app:
- The Auth0 Domain Name
- The Auth0 Client ID
The JWT token contains the permissions for the 'Principal', 'Viceprincipal', 'Counseller' roles.
